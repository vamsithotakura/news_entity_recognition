## NOTE
1. Capped off implementation at three hours - this project is a bit heavy on the UI side and also requires deep working knowledge of react frameworks.
2. Need to re-work on UI renderings and CSS.

## TO-DO :
1. Improve UI rendering - current UI implementation is super basic and is far off from the ideal.
2. Figure out `useEffect` state-hooks.
3. Refactor basic table to a third party react-component. 
4. Clean-up UI rendering and leverage `useEffect` state-hook.
5. Improve CSS look and feel.
